 ## About project
This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice at diffrent intervals.
When one of the players rolls the dice and gets a score 2 - 6,it's added to their turn total and they have a chance to
continue playing or hold!
When the player chooses to "hold"(pass their turn), their turn total is added to their total score,
and it becomes the next player's turn.
When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
The player who scores 100 first and more points wins the game!
